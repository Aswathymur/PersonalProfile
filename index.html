            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <img class="images" src="images/aswathy-profile.jpg">
            <div class="intro">

                Myself Aswathy Murali Ottur. I have been based in Melbourne since 2014. I am initially from Bangalore,
                India. With my childhood spent in two different, vibrant countries, I have changed to adapt to both. The
                cultures of both countries have a huge influence on who I am and what I enjoy doing. Music and Dance are
                my passion. I am a huge fan of Bolly-Hop. Bolly-Hop is a fusion dance form that incorporates the
                movements of hip hop with some Bollywood charm. Choreographing dances for other dance teams and my own
                is something I do as a hobby. If nothing, I usually just put on some music and move to it, even if it is
                just for a minute or two.
                I love to travel; I try my best to at least step out of the country for a month every year. Covid-19 is
                a huge set back to all my plans. As small memorabilia, I collect T-shirts with the name of the country
                on it. Traveling is something I picked up with my love for food. I love experimenting with my food and
                trying new cuisines. Going back to India from time to time refreshes me with everything that country
                offers me with Family, food, adventure, and fun!
                I can read and write 3 languages and can speak 4 (Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi and English).
                Portrait sketching is another small passion I hold. I love giving the characters in my head some shape
                and poise. I pick up these characters on my way to and from the university on the trains or in some
                events that I attend.

            <h1>INTEREST IN IT</h1>
            <div class="it">
                2009, when Windows 7 was still new, and clipart was a huge hit amongst the students, I
                joined an animation competition that was taking place at my school back in Bangalore. It was based on a
                small animation tool known as Alice 3. Winning this inter-school competition, opened a huge interest in
                this
                field. I have always been curious in terms of technology. With each phone to each PC that gets released,
                I
                have always wanted to understand more of it and make full use of it. After finishing my VCE in 2018, I
                went
                on to do an internship with St. Peter's College as a Front Desk IT support. I worked there for a whole
                school year and did all sorts of work, from imaging laptop, fixing students computer issues, lodging
                insurance claims, performing regular checks on servers, printer maintenance to picking up the phone
                every
                time to say, "Hello IT, Have you tried turning it Off and On again?" . The internship allowed me to get
                a
                front-hand exposure of work in the real world. Together with this internship I also did a certificate
                course
                in Information Digital Media and Technology. The internship was a great opportunity to expand my
                industry
                connection. This experience also showed me how quick technology grows. A younger student from the school
                could not recognize a Floppy disk. The student thought we had 3d printed the save button on Microsoft
                Word!
                This again proves how true Moore's Law is! RMIT has always interested me. The course structure and the
                flexibility of the subjects are a huge plus to the uni. A wide range of expertise available in the field
                of
                IT. The International programs available through RMIT and the varied countries and different
                international
                course structures. Through my time at RMIT, I am looking forward to improving my existing skills while
                also
                picking up new ones. Being able to work in teams with varied people across globe and to being able to
                grow
                as person with a good understanding of my strengths and weaknesses.</br></br></div>
            
            <h1>IDEAL JOB</h1>
            <div class="ij">

                After my graduation from my bachelor’s program, I am set out to do my masters in Data Science. Data is a
                huge point of interest for me. With 2.5 quintillion (That is 18 0’s) bytes of Data created every single
                day, managing it is a huge task. Without a proper database and the ability to query it, all this data
                will have no meaningful interpretation.
                I have always admired Google, and its growth as an organisation and as an influence on young minds and
                people. The world runs on google and working for such an organisation is much more than what I can ask
                for. Google also played an initial role in growing my interest in the field of IT.</br>

                        here</a> to view the job.</p>
                </br>
                This job has a very high requirement, but I am planning on starting to work towards it from this time
                on. With my passion towards data this job is the ideal job that I would like to star working towards.
                This job is also advertised by Google, making it a special point of interest for me.
                The minimum requirement for this job is as following.
                - 2 years of experience with Oracle databases (versions 12c and above).
                - Coding experience in one or more multi-purpose languages such as Python, Perl or Go.
                - Experience with scripting common DBA recurring tasks.
                I have not met the requirements yet as I am just starting off my study in this field. This job requires
                years of experience in the field, and with an organisation like google, the amount of data to deal with
                and the severity of the job also increases. Being very experienced and confident with my skills is very
                important to take on a job like this.
                The skills I currently have are basic SQL and data managements skills paired with basic python and java.
                Have been worked in an UT department, I have worked with the DBA team and gained information in the same
                to understand how organisations work with data different from the theory learnt.
                As a I said earlier I am planning on continuing my studies after my bachelors to doing Masters in Data
                Science. During my bachelor’s I am also focusing on Data oriented subjects paired with development and
                programming courses.</br></br>

            <div class="personality">

                I am 70% of a visual learner. 10% of an auditory learner and 20% of a kinaesthetic learner. </br>

            <!-- </div> -->
            <!-- <div class="personality1"> -->
                According to Myers-Briggs test I am an ‘advocate’. My character type is said to make up less than one
                percent of the population and they are also most definitely said to leave their mark in this world. What
                sets my character type apart is the fact that we are not idle dreamers. As much as I enjoy my time spent
                with family and friends, I also like to take some time off to just to sit back and take a deep breathe.
                I am a strong believer of the saying “you start to live the moment you stop competing with others”, but
                I also believe in the saying “Your success begins when you start competing with yourself”. It is amazing
                to know that these tests can understand your character with such a high rate of accuracy.
                The results of these tests helped me realise my strengths and most importantly my weaknesses. When
                working in a team I will most importantly know my weaknesses and how I can handle them.
                Knowing from my own personal experience, I have worked hard for everything and anything I have achieved,
                from a small dance competition to my major exams.
                This obviously has its downside to it, when I do not get what I had set out for, I usually take time to
                cope. The test accurately states that this is one of my weak points, but what the website does not state
                is how quick I get back on track.
                Team work bring different personalities together. Different personalities when working together combine
                varied skills to bring out the best in a team. These personality tests will help me improve as a person
                to bring out the best in me.</br>

            <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
            <div class="proidea">

                With the world getting familiarised with biometrics and its fast authentications, from mobile phones to
                card payments will all go biometric in no time. Biometric have been implemented in high level security
                checks including the ones in our border securities. With the growth of biometrics authentication for
                access control, its popularity has grown immensely with various purposes and uses.</br>
            </br>
                Fingerprint biometric is one of the most convenient method preferred by most of users. Studies show that
                fingerprint authentication on mobile phones to unlock phones and apps have been widely accepted by all
                types of users.</br>
            </br>
                Public transport sector of Victoria had its highest growth in the recent years as well. With an average
                of 1M+ myki touch ons every day, 104,515 mobile myki users and 605M+ trips taken just in the past year
                the industry continues to grow. With these high rates of travel, fines in this sector has also had a
                huge increase.</br>
            </br>
                Carrying around multiple cards and maintaining them itself is a huge task. Most public transport users
                buy more than one card just to avoid the hefty fines. Everyday commuters are said buy at least 3 cards
                in a year of travel. Each card topped up with money but later forgotten about. Tourists when they enter
                Melbourne also find it confusing get started off with a myki.
                With the current RFID system in place, the myki card has no individual identity cannot be distinguished
                from others. This leads to various confusion in a household in everyday life. Using a wrong card (child
                instead of an adult) can bring home a hefty fine of up to $250.</br>
            </br>
                A solution for this issue is to combine both fingerprint biometrics with the public transport ticketing
                system. The user can top up their accounts by just scanning their fingerprint on a top up machine and
                can touch on and touch off as they commute with just a touch of a finger.</br>
            </br>
                The busy morning commutes can be made much easier if a RFID card system was replaced with a fingerprint
                biometric system. During the morning rush most of the commuters spend time looking for their myki cards
                and this system will help reduce that stress and promote more travellers to travel stress free.
                Descriptions</br>
            </br>
                Apart from the hardware requirements, the aim is to create a back-end system where the fingerprint
                biometrics of a person can be linked to their personal myki accounts. Like in a myki card, the biometric
                is linked to a database where the account details are kept track off. This database will be looked after
                by a DBA of the company. A smart card linked to the user’s phone is also attached to their biometric in
                the database. In case of a situation where their fingerprint cannot be used the smart phone that is
                connected to a smart card can be used to scan and access the users’ account.</br>
            </br>
                The fingerprint scanner present at the start of every commute has a light sensor microchip to produce a
                digital image of the fingerprint, which is then converted to a code. This code is later matched with the
                database to retrieve the account details of the user.
                There will be light indicators on the scanner to indicate the balance available on the account. Green to
                show that there is enough money for a minimum of two commutes, a orange light indicator to show there is
                enough money for one commute and a red light indicator to show that there is not enough money left in
                their account.</br>
            </br>
                When a user creates their account, they are to install an app or log in through the online digital card
                portal to get a digital card. The user is to then add their fingerprint to the account through a
                fingerprint scanner at one of the 222 train stations available across the state. The encrypted code
                produced with their fingerprint is then linked to their already created account. Their account can be
                topped up online using their online account portal or through the top up machines available at the
                stations. Once they have an account and it is topped up, all they have to do when starting their journey
                is just scan their finger while entering and exiting their commute.</br>
            </br>
                An IR Led can also be installed as an Extended Viable feature to avoid forgery. This allows to track the
                users that walk past the scanners without scanning their fingerprint. This triggers an alarm letting the
                driver know that a user has entered without scanning their fingerprint.</br>
            </br>
                This system will allow the commuters to travel with ease and free of stress. They do not have to carry
                the responsibility of taking care of another card, adding to their already existing list of cards. Thus,
                system will also work as a huge benefit to the government to track criminals or to track any missing
                individual.</br>
            </br>
                The downside to this system is when children under the age of 10 commute. Their fingerprints would not
                have fully matured and will be constantly changing. This can be resolved by letting the parents or the
                care giver have the right to open an account for the child and using their device to scan a digital card
                on behalf of the child. The child later can create their own account with their fingerprint.</br>
            
                
                <h2>Tools, Technologies and Skills Required</h2>

                <h3>Hardware:</h3>
                Finger print Scanner is initially used in this process to add the users finger print to the database and
                then it is later used to track the users commute and account details. Data, base storage plays another
                important role in this system. When creating a system for a whole state, the data storage will be huge
                with additional users being added every day.</br>
                <h3>Software:</h3>
                Skills in C# is core requirement for the conversion of Fingerprint biometrics to code. This plays an
                important role as this acts as one of the initial stages of the process. Adding on to that, Java, SQL,
                jQuery are other key languages needed to implement this system.
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                After this system is implemented the transport system will have a huge increase in positive commuters.
                With easy access to trains and commutes the economy of the industry will also rise. The commuters will
                be able to jump on and off public transports without worrying about carrying or losing a card. This also
                save resources, with little to no frequent updating needed to the system. It will also reduce the
                confusion between different types of myki card (adult, child, concession). Updating the required plan in
                the database that is linked to the fingerprint will reduce card mix ups and hefty fines.
